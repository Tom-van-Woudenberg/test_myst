# ... for bending

The differential equation for kinematic relations for bending is based on a displaced the infinitesimal small beam:

```

leading to :

$${\varphi} =  - \frac{{{\rm{d}}w}}{{{\rm{d}}x}}$$

and

:align: center
```

leading to :

$${\kappa} =  \frac{{{\rm{d}}\varphi}}{{{\rm{d}}x}}$$

This is treated in chapter 4.3.1 of the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 2 {cite:p}`Hartsuijker2007`.
