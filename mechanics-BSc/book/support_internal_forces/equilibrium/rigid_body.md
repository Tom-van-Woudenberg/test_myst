# ... of a body

By applying equilibrium to the free-body diagram of a body  you can find unknown forces and moments which prevent motion (translation and rotation). The concept of equilibrium of a body is treated in chapter 3.1.1 of the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 1 {cite:p}`Hartsuijker2006`. At maximum three unknown forces (of which maximum one couple) can be solved in a planar problem and six forces in a threedimensional problem. The steps involved are:

1. Draw a [free body diagram](free-body-diagram) of the body
2. Split the forces in convenient directions by applying [resolution of forces](resolution_forces)
3. Solve the forces and moments using $\sum F  = 0$  in two nonparallel convenient directions and ${\left. {\sum T } \right|_x} = 0$ for any arbitrary points $x$ as treated in chapter 3.1.5 of the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 1 {cite:p}`Hartsuijker2006`. For threedimensional problem, moments are taken around a line as treated in chapter 3.3.2. The full procedure for planar problems is shown in chapter 3.2 and for threedimensional problems in chapter 3.4.
