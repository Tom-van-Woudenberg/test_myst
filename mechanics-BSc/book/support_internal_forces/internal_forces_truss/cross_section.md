# ... using equilibrium in a specific cross-section

There are two methods which can be applied. In general, it is advised to first solve for the [support reactions](support) and identify [zero-force members](zero-force_members).

## Method of joints

```{figure} ./cross-section_data/joints.svg
:align: center
```

This method investigates [free-body-diagrams of individual joints](free_body_diagram_node) and uses [force equilibrium of a particle](equilibrium_particle) to solve the section forces. It is treated in chapter 9.3.2 of the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 1 {cite:p}`Hartsuijker2006`.

## Method of sections

```

This method investigates [free-body-diagrams of parts of the structure](free_body_diagram_part) and uses [force and moment equilibrium](equilibrium_body) to solve the section forces. It is treated in chapter 9.3.2 of the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 1 {cite:p}`Hartsuijker2006`.
