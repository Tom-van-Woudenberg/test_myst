# ... for bending

The differential equation for equilibrium relations for bending is based on the infinitesimal small loaded beam:

leading to :

$${q_z} =  - \frac{{{\rm{d}}V}}{{{\rm{d}}x}}$$

$${V} =  \frac{{{\rm{d}}M}}{{{\rm{d}}x}}$$

This is treated in chapter 11.1 of the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 1 {cite:p}`Hartsuijker2006`.
