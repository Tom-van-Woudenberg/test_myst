# Resolution of forces

THe resolution of forces allows you to split up a force in other directions. In most cases, resolution of forces in the direction of the [global or local coordinate system](coordinatesystem) is most useful.

The resolution of forces works both for planar forces (at least one of $R_x$, $R_y$ or $R_z$ equals $0$), and forces in 3-dimensional space. An example of both of these forces is shown in {numref}`planar_vs_3d`. In statics, mostly planar structures are considered, but the procedure of composing and resolving force are identical.
