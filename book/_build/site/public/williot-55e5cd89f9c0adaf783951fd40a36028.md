Figure 7.6 {cite:ts}`Hartsuijker2007`
```

This is treated in chapter 7.2 and 7.3 of the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 2 {cite:p}`Hartsuijker2007`. There's a mistake in the figures in chapter 7.3. The vertical height of the truss structure should be $1.5 \text{ m}$. The scale and williot diagrams are correct.
