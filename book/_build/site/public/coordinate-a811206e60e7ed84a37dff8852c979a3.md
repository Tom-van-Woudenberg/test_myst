```{index} Global coordinate system
```
## Global coordinate system
Global coordinate systems are treated in the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 1 in chapter 1.3.2 {cite}`Hartsuijker2006`.

At Delft University of Technology, we normally point $x$ to the right, $z$ downwards and $y$ towards the reader. And in a planar problem we have $x$ to the right and $z$ downwards.

## Local coordinate system
Local coordinate systems are treated in the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 1 in chapter 10.3 including figure 10.36 and 10.37 {cite}`Hartsuijker2006`.
