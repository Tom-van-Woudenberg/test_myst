## Longitudinal shear stresses

The shear force per unit length in the longitudinal direction is given by:

$$s_x^a = -\cfrac{dM_z}{dx} \cfrac{S_z^a}{I_{zz}} = -\cfrac{V_zS_z^a}{I_{zz}}$$

or alternatively:

$$s_x^a =  - {V_z}\cfrac{{{N^a}\left( {{\text{due to }}M_z^*} \right)}}{{M_z^*}}$$

The shear stress is given by:

$$\sigma_{mx} = \frac{s_x^a}{b^a}$$

This is treated in chapter 5.1 and 5.2 of the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 2 {cite:p}`Hartsuijker2007`.

## Cross-sectional shear stresses

The shear stress in the cross-sectional direction is givenby:

$$\sigma_{xm} = \frac{s_x^a}{b^a}$$

This is treated in chapter 5.3 and 5.4 of the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 2 {cite:p}`Hartsuijker2007`.
