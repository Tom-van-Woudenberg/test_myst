# ... for extension

The differential equation for kinematic relations for extension is based on a displaced the infinitesimal small beam:

leading to :

$${\epsilon} =  - \frac{{{\rm{d}}u}}{{{\rm{d}}x}}$$

This is treated in chapter 2.2.1 of the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 2 {cite:p}`Hartsuijker2007`.
