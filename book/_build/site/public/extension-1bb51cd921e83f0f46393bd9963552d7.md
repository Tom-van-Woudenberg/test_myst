# ... for extension

The differential equation for equilibrium relations for extension is based on the infinitesimal small loaded bar:

leading to :

$${q_x} =  - \frac{{{\rm{d}}N}}{{{\rm{d}}x}}$$

This is treated in chapter 11.1 of the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 1 {cite:p}`Hartsuijker2006`.
