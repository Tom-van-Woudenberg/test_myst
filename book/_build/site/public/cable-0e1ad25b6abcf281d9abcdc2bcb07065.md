The differential equation for equilibrium relations for cables is based on the infinitesimal small loaded cables:

leading to :

$${q_z} =  - \frac{{{\rm{d}}V}}{{{\rm{d}}x}}$$

$${V} =  H\frac{{{\rm{d}}z}}{{{\rm{d}}x}}$$

This is treated in chapter 14.1.3 of the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 1 {cite:p}`Hartsuijker2006`.
