# ... of a planar particle

By applying equilibrium to the free-body diagram of a particle you can find unknown forces. At maximum two unknown forces can be solved in a planar problem and three forces in a threedimensional problem. The steps involved are:

1. Draw the [free body diagram](free-body-diagram) of the particle
2. Split the forces in convenient directions by applying [resolution of forces](resolution_forces)
3. Solve the forces using $\sum F  = 0$ in two nonparallel convenient directions. This step is treated in chapter 2.3.2 of the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 1 {cite:p}`Hartsuijker2006`.
