A distinction can be made whether or not equilibrium relations are enough to solve:
- support reactions (external static indeterminancy)
- section forces (internal static indeterminancy)

These two categories are treated together in chapter 4.5.2 and 4.5.3 of the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 1 {cite:p}`Hartsuijker2006`.

For [truss structures](truss_structures), the analysis is simplified as shown in chapter 9.2.2 of the book Engineering Mechanics Volume 1 {cite:p}`Hartsuijker2006`.
