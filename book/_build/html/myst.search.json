This introduction is derived from the introduction into SymPy from Jason Moore (CC-BY licensed) \n\nMoore (2023) and the SymPy Tutorial (Copyright (c) 2006-2023 SymPy Development Team) \n\nSymPy Development Team (2023).\n\n","type":"content","url":"/sympy#sympy-in-general","position":3},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"SymPy in general","lvl2":"Why SymPy?"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/sympy#why-sympy","position":4},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"SymPy in general","lvl2":"Why SymPy?"},"content":"... and not Wolfram Alpha, Mathematica, Maple, GeoGebra, your fancy calculator, or ...?\n\nFirst off, SymPy is completely free. It is open source, and licensed under the liberal BSD license, so you can modify the source code and even sell it if you want to. This contrasts with popular commercial systems like Maple or Mathematica that cost hundreds of dollars in licenses.\n\nSecond, SymPy uses Python. Most computer algebra systems invent their own language. Not SymPy. SymPy is written entirely in Python, and is executed entirely in Python. This means that if you already know Python, it is much easier to get started with SymPy, because you already know the syntax (and if you don’t know Python, it is really easy to learn). We already know that Python is a well-designed, battle-tested language. The SymPy developers are confident in their abilities in writing mathematical software, but programming language design is a completely different thing. By reusing an existing language, we are able to focus on those things that matter: the mathematics.\n\nAnother computer algebra system, Sage also uses Python as its language. But Sage is large, with a download of over a gigabyte. An advantage of SymPy is that it is lightweight. In addition to being relatively small, it has no dependencies other than Python, so it can be used almost anywhere easily. Furthermore, the goals of Sage and the goals of SymPy are different. Sage aims to be a full featured system for mathematics, and aims to do so by compiling all the major open source mathematical systems together into one. When you call some function in Sage, such as integrate, it calls out to one of the open source packages that it includes. In fact, SymPy is included in Sage. SymPy on the other hand aims to be an independent system, with all the features implemented in SymPy itself.\n\nA final important feature of SymPy is that it can be used as a library. Many computer algebra systems focus on being usable in interactive environments, but if you wish to automate or extend them, it is difficult to do. With SymPy, you can just as easily use it in an interactive Python environment or import it in your own Python application. SymPy also provides APIs to make it easy to extend it with your own custom functions.\n\n\nSymPy Development Team (2023)\n\n","type":"content","url":"/sympy#why-sympy","position":5},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"SymPy in general","lvl2":"First steps"},"type":"lvl2","url":"/sympy#first-steps","position":6},{"hierarchy":{"lvl1":"SymPy in general","lvl2":"First steps"},"content":"\n\nLet’s take an example. Say we wanted to use the built-in Python functions to compute square roots. We might do something like this:\n\nimport math\nmath.sqrt(8)\n\nHere we got an approximate result, which is not the exact square root of 8. If all we cared about was the decimal form of the square root of 8, we would be done.\n\nBut suppose we want to go further. Recall that \\sqrt{8} = \\sqrt{ 4 \\cdot 2} = 2 \\sqrt{2}\n. We would have a hard time deducing this from the above result. This is where symbolic computation comes in. With a symbolic computation system like SymPy, square roots of numbers that are not perfect squares are left unevaluated by default\n\nWe’ll import SymPy as follows:\n\nimport sympy as sym\n\nSince SymPy works with mathematical symbols it’s nice to view SymPy objects in\na format that is similar to the math in a textbook.

Let’s define a symbolic expression, representing the mathematical expression x + 2y. The most basic way to construct expressions is with the standard Python operators +, -, *, /, and **. For example:\n\nexpr = x + 2*y\nexpr\n\nNote that we wrote x + 2*y just as we would if x and y were ordinary Python variables. But in this case, instead of evaluating to something, the expression remains as just x + 2y. Now let us play around with it:\n\nexpr + 1\n\nexpr - x\n\nNotice something in the above example. When we typed expr - x, we did not get x + 2y - x, but rather just 2y. The x and the -x automatically canceled one another. This is similar to how \\sqrt{8} automatically turned into 2\\sqrt{2} above. This isn’t always the case in SymPy;  Aside from obvious simplifications like x - x = 0 and \\sqrt{8} = 2\\sqrt{2}, most simplifications are not performed automatically.\n\nA general formula to simplify formulas is sym.simplify, which attempts to apply all of these functions in an intelligent way to arrive at the simplest form of an expression:\n\nexpr2 = sym.sin(x)**2+sym.cos(x)**2\nexpr2\n\nsym.simplify(expr2)\n\nOnly attempt simplification on expressions that are several lines of text. Larger expressions become increasingly computationally intensive to simplify and there is generally no need to do so.\n\nIn many cases, our expressions include a left- and right-hand-side. We cannot use == for that (== checks the similarity of the python-object), but we can use the sym.Eq function to create the symbolic equality x + 2y = 3:\n\nsym.Eq(expr,3)\n\nWhen setting up these expressions, watch out! Be careful with numbers, as SymPy may not intepret them as expected. For example:\n\n1/2*x\n\nPython does the division before it is multiplied by x, thus a floating point value is created.

The beam is loaded with a uniform load q on a part of the beam and a force F.

Furthermore the .subs() function fill in a value in your expression:\n\nEq1 = sym.Eq(w_AC.subs(x, 0), 0) \nEq2 = sym.Eq(M_AC.subs(x, 0), 0)\nEq3 = sym.Eq(w_AC.subs(x, 4), w_CD.subs(x, 4))\nEq4 = sym.Eq(phi_AC.subs(x, 4), phi_CD.subs(x, 4))\nEq5 = sym.Eq(M_AC.subs(x, 4), M_CD.subs(x, 4))\nEq6 = sym.Eq(V_AC.subs(x, 4), V_CD.subs(x, 4))\nEq7 = sym.Eq(w_CD.subs(x, 9), w_DB.subs(x, 9))\nEq8 = sym.Eq(phi_CD.subs(x, 9), phi_DB.subs(x, 9))\nEq9 = sym.Eq(V_CD.subs(x, 9), V_DB.subs(x, 9)+F)\nEq10 = sym.Eq(M_CD.subs(x, 9), M_DB.subs(x, 9))\nEq11 = sym.Eq(w_DB.subs(x, 15), 0)\nEq12 = sym.Eq(M_DB.subs(x, 15), 0)\n\ndisplay(Eq7)\n\nNow we use the function sym.solve to solve our system of equations for our integration constants:\n\nsol = sym.solve((Eq1,Eq2,Eq3,Eq4,Eq5,Eq6,Eq7,Eq8,Eq9,Eq10,Eq11,Eq12), (C1,C2,C3,C4,C5,C6,C7,C8,C9,C10,C11,C12))\ndisplay(sol)\n\nWe can use .subs() again to substitute this solution in our original function:\n\ndisplay(w_AC.subs(sol))\n\nInstead of symbolic values, you could have worked with numerical values too from the beginning. Nevertheless, we can substitute some random values with out final expression too, including a value for x. Use .evalf() to show the decimal form of your answer:\n\ndisplay(w_CD.subs(sol).subs(EI,50000).subs(q,10).subs(F,35).subs(x,6))\ndisplay(w_CD.subs(sol).subs(EI,50000).subs(q,10).subs(F,35).subs(x,6).evalf())\n\nYou can plot the results too.
